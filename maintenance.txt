# Aircraft Maintenance Tracking: Architecture & Workflow

## Overview
This document describes the minimal, robust approach for tracking aircraft maintenance, due dates, and costs in the database. It covers how to keep "last visit" and "next due" columns up to date for each component, and how the workflow operates in practice.

---

## 1. Key Tables

### aircraft
- Holds aircraft details (registration, type, total_hours, etc.)

### aircraft_equipment (or aircraft_components)
- Tracks all components/inspections for each aircraft.
- Key fields:
  - `component_type` (e.g., Battery, Inspection)
  - `interval_type` ('HOURS', 'CALENDAR', 'BOTH')
  - `interval_hours`, `interval_days`
  - `current_due_date`, `current_due_hours`
  - `last_completed_date`, `last_completed_hours`
  - `status`, `priority`, `notes`

### maintenance_visits
- Logs each maintenance event (date, type, description, cost, etc.)
- Links to aircraft and optionally to a component.

### (Optional) maintenance_costs
- For detailed cost breakdowns (labor, parts, etc.)

---

## 2. Maintenance Workflow

### A. Initial Setup
1. Add aircraft to the system.
2. For each aircraft, add components/inspections to `aircraft_equipment`, specifying intervals, due dates/hours, and priorities.

### B. Daily Operations
- Query `aircraft_equipment` for items where `current_due_date` or `current_due_hours` is approaching.
- Show these on a dashboard as "Due Soon."

### C. Performing Maintenance
1. When maintenance is performed, create a `maintenance_visits` record.
2. Record the date, type, description, technician, hours, and cost.
3. For each component serviced:
   - Update `last_completed_date` and `last_completed_hours`.
   - Calculate and update `current_due_date` and `current_due_hours` based on the interval.

### D. Cost Tracking
- Enter the cost in `maintenance_visits.total_cost` (or in `maintenance_costs` if you want breakdowns).

---

## 3. Keeping Dates and Hours Up to Date

### Core Principle
- The `aircraft_equipment` table holds the current state for each component:
  - When it's next due (`current_due_date`, `current_due_hours`)
  - When it was last completed (`last_completed_date`, `last_completed_hours`)
- Each maintenance event is logged in `maintenance_visits` (and optionally, `maintenance_costs`).

### Update Workflow
1. Maintenance visit is marked as "Completed" in the app.
2. For each component serviced:
   - Update `last_completed_date` = date maintenance was performed
   - Update `last_completed_hours` = aircraft hours at completion
   - If interval is calendar-based: `current_due_date` = `last_completed_date` + `interval_days`
   - If interval is hours-based: `current_due_hours` = `last_completed_hours` + `interval_hours`
   - If both: set both fields; whichever comes first triggers the next due
3. Optionally, log the update in `maintenance_visit_items` for audit/history.

### Implementation
- In the app/API: When a maintenance visit is completed, run a transaction that updates both the visit and the relevant component(s).
- Optionally, use a database trigger for automation, but app logic is usually simpler and easier to debug.

## 4. Example SQL for Due Items
```sql
SELECT 
  a.registration,
  e.name AS component_name,
  e.current_due_date,
  e.current_due_hours,
  a.total_hours,
  CASE 
    WHEN e.current_due_hours IS NOT NULL 
    THEN e.current_due_hours - a.total_hours 
    ELSE NULL 
  END as hours_remaining,
  CASE 
    WHEN e.current_due_date IS NOT NULL 
    THEN DATEDIFF(e.current_due_date, NOW()) 
    ELSE NULL 
  END as days_remaining
FROM aircraft_equipment e
JOIN aircraft a ON e.aircraft_id = a.id
WHERE 
  (e.current_due_date <= DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)) 
  OR 
  (e.current_due_hours <= a.total_hours + 50)
ORDER BY 
  COALESCE(e.current_due_date, '9999-12-31'),
  COALESCE(e.current_due_hours, 999999);
```

---

## 5. Benefits
- **Simple:** Only two tables need to be updated per maintenance event.
- **Reliable:** The "current" state is always in the component row, so queries for "what's due" are fast and simple.
- **Auditable:** The full history of what was done, when, and by whom is in `maintenance_visits` (and optionally, `maintenance_visit_items`).
- **Flexible:** Handles both hour-based and calendar-based maintenance, and can be extended if needed.

## 6. Summary Table
| Action                        | Table(s) Updated           | Fields Updated                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Complete maintenance visit    | maintenance_visits         | status, total_cost, etc.                       |
|                               | aircraft_equipment         | last_completed_date/hours, current_due_date/hours |
|                               | (optional) maintenance_visit_items | work_performed, etc.                    |

---

## 7. In Practice
- User completes maintenance in UI → API call updates both the visit and the component(s) in a transaction.
- Dashboard queries always use the "current_due_date" and "current_due_hours" fields for what's due.
- History and costs are always available in the visits table.

---

## 8. Keeping Aircraft Last/Next Maintenance Dates Up to Date (Triggers & Functions)

### Why?
- The `aircraft` table has `last_maintenance_date` and `next_maintenance_date` fields.
- These should always reflect the most recent completed maintenance and the soonest upcoming due date for each aircraft.
- To ensure data integrity and reduce manual errors, use a database function and trigger to keep these fields in sync automatically.

### When to Update
- Whenever a maintenance visit is marked as 'Completed' in `maintenance_visits`.

### How It Works
1. **Function:**
   - Sets `last_maintenance_date` to the latest `visit_date` from `maintenance_visits` where status = 'Completed'.
   - Sets `next_maintenance_date` to the soonest `current_due_date` from `aircraft_equipment` where due date is in the future.
2. **Trigger:**
   - After an insert or update on `maintenance_visits` (when status becomes 'Completed'), call the function for the relevant `aircraft_id`.

### Example SQL Implementation

#### A. Update Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_aircraft_maintenance_dates(aircraft_id uuid)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  last_date timestamptz;
  next_date timestamptz;
BEGIN
  -- Find the most recent completed maintenance visit
  SELECT MAX(visit_date)
    INTO last_date
    FROM maintenance_visits
   WHERE aircraft_id = update_aircraft_maintenance_dates.aircraft_id
     AND status = 'Completed';

  -- Find the soonest due date from components
  SELECT MIN(current_due_date)
    INTO next_date
    FROM aircraft_equipment
   WHERE aircraft_id = update_aircraft_maintenance_dates.aircraft_id
     AND current_due_date > NOW();

  -- Update the aircraft table
  UPDATE aircraft
     SET last_maintenance_date = last_date,
         next_maintenance_date = next_date
   WHERE id = update_aircraft_maintenance_dates.aircraft_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### B. Trigger
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trg_maintenance_visit_completed()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Only run if status is set to 'Completed'
  IF NEW.status = 'Completed' THEN
    PERFORM update_aircraft_maintenance_dates(NEW.aircraft_id);
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER after_maintenance_visit_completed
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON maintenance_visits
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION trg_maintenance_visit_completed();
```

### Workflow Summary
- Any time a maintenance visit is completed, the trigger fires.
- The function recalculates and updates the `last_maintenance_date` and `next_maintenance_date` for the aircraft.
- Your dashboard and queries always show the correct, up-to-date values.

### Benefits
- **Automated:** No manual intervention needed to keep aircraft maintenance dates accurate.
- **Reliable:** Ensures the `aircraft` table always reflects the true maintenance state.
- **Auditable:** All updates are based on actual maintenance records and component schedules.

Scenario: OIL FILTER Replacement Every 50 Hours
1. Setup (Admin/Engineer)
Component Creation:
The OIL FILTER is added as a row in the aircraft_components table.
Fields:
name: "Oil Filter"
component_type: "service"
interval_type: "HOURS"
interval_hours: 50
current_due_hours: (e.g., 1300)
last_completed_hours: (e.g., 1250)
status: "active"
priority: "medium"
notes: "Replace with approved filter only"
UI:
This appears in the Equipment & Components tab, showing when it’s next due (e.g., "Due in 5 hours").
2. Monitoring (Daily Use)
UI:
As the aircraft is flown, the current hours increase.
The OIL FILTER row in the table shows "Due in X hours" and a progress bar.
When it’s within 10% of due, it’s highlighted as "Due Soon".
3. Due for Service
UI:
When the aircraft reaches 1300 hours, the OIL FILTER row is highlighted as "Due now".
In the Servicing tab, the OIL FILTER appears in the list of services due.
4. Booking & Logging the Maintenance Visit
User Action:
The engineer or admin clicks “Schedule” or “Log Maintenance” for the OIL FILTER.
A Maintenance Visit is created (in maintenance_visits):
aircraft_id: (the aircraft)
component_id: (the OIL FILTER)
visit_date: (today)
visit_type: "Scheduled"
description: "Oil filter replaced"
hours_at_visit: 1300
status: "Completed"
notes: "Used Champion CH48108-1"
UI:
This visit appears in the Maintenance History for the aircraft/component.
5. Updating the Component
Automatic or Manual Update:
When the maintenance visit is marked as "Completed":
The OIL FILTER’s last_completed_hours is updated to 1300.
The current_due_hours is set to 1350 (1300 + 50).
The last_completed_date is set to today.
The current_due_date is recalculated if needed (for calendar-based intervals).
UI:
The OIL FILTER row now shows the next due at 1350 hours, and the progress bar resets.
6. Logging the Cost
User Action:
In the maintenance visit details, the user adds a Maintenance Cost:
maintenance_visit_id: (the visit)
aircraft_component_id: (the OIL FILTER)
cost_type: "Parts"
description: "Oil filter"
quantity: 1
unit_cost: 100
total_cost: 100
supplier_vendor: "AeroParts Ltd"
invoice_reference: "INV-12345"
UI:
The cost appears in the visit’s cost breakdown and in reporting/analytics.
7. Ongoing Cycle
The process repeats:
The OIL FILTER is now tracked for the next 50 hours.
All history, costs, and compliance are logged and auditable.
